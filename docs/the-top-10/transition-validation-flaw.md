# Transition Validation Flaw

## Overview

This class of vulnerabilities arises when systems advance workflows without confirming that required prior conditions for
a transaction are met, letting attackers advance the business process without fully completing the previous steps. For
instance,

These gaps can occur in APIs, web forms, network protocols, or any user-driven process, leading to fraud, data exposure,
or service disruption


## Description

At their core, these weaknesses reflect a failure to enforce the integrity of business sequences and flow controls. They
fall into these three patterns:

* **Steps performed out of required order:** Attackers trigger later-stage actions before fulfilling earlier prerequisites.
* **Omitting mandatory checks:** Critical validations (for example payment verification or session setup) are never executed,
so workflows jump ahead.
* **Skipping or deferring flow enforcement:*. Validation logic runs too late or in the wrong scope, allowing unintended transitions.

Consequences span financial loss, unauthorized access, and process deadlocks. These faults may escape standard role-based
or input-validation tests because they exploit missing or misplaced business-process logic rather than broken permissions
or malformed data


## Examples

### Scenario #1: Skip checkout validation by manipulation the quantity of products

A vulnerability in spa-cartcms version 1.9.0.6 allows improper enforcement of behavioral workflow on the Checkout Page
component.
By submitting a negative value, such as -10, for the 'quantity' parameter, an attacker can bypass intended workflow validations.
This flaw allows unauthorized manipulation of the checkout process, potentially leading to unintended behavior or unauthorized
transactions.

The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring user interaction or elevated privileges.


### Scenario #2: Users can check out unpublished products in microweber

microweber â‰¤2024.04.1 lets attackers purchase items that an admin has unpublished or deleted by skipping the publication-check step in the checkout flow. As a result, attackers can acquire unavailable products, disrupting inventory controls and business workflows:

1. Admin unpublishes a product:

```shell
POST /api/shop/items/publish
{
    "itemId":55,
    "action":"unpublish"
}
```

At this moment, products are not visible to users.

2. However, an attacker can still add check out such item using APIs:

```shell
POST /api/shop/checkout
{
  "itemId": 55
}
```
